This is my first book by Robert Jordan and I wasn’t sure what to expect of it, specially since it was written so many years ago and I was afraid that culture biases might have affected the writing. I’m happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed it and at times I thought that I was reading another work by my favorite author Brandon Sanderson.

The book starts with the suicide of the one dubbed ‘The Dragon’ after realising that he, under the influence of the Dark One, had killed all his loved ones.

The story revolves around three boys (Rand, Mat and Perrin) from a remote village. There's no mistery for the reader that Rand is the Dragon reborn, and I, at first thought, no, I feared that the trope of the chosen one, would render all of these side characters meaningless, but this book surpassed my expectations.

### What I liked
* Splitting the group up. It lead to many opportunities to flesh out the characters and the world.
* There's more to this world than just 'The One Power'. Perrin being able to communicate with wolves was an unexpected and pleasant surprise, and I'm eager to see what more is there of the 'old ways'.

## Conclusion
This is a great start to the series and I am hooked into it. Good thing that Brandon Sanderson was tasked with wrapping up the series after Robert Jordan passed away, I don't think I would have started this series if the story couldn't be finished
