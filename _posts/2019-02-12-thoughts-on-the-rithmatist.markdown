Who would have thought that a chalk-based magic system would be interesting? Well, certainly not me, but the Rithmatist provides a good and compelling read.

We follow the life of Joel, a high school student, who despite being a regular person, is fascinated by the magical art of Rithmatics. 

What is Rithmatics you say? Well it’s basically chalk come to life. A rithmatist can draw a defensive circle around himself to keep attackers at bay, and for offense he can draw either a ‘line of vigor’ (lines that get shot forward), or a chalkling, which for all intents and purposes, are creatures that can be created from any form (humanoid, beast) and be given instructions.

The premise of the book is that rithmatist students have begun to go missing, and all evidence points to another rithmatist being the perpetrator. Strange new rithmatic lines have all been found at the crime scenes, and Joel's school becomes the focal point of the government to protect the remaining students.

## What I liked
* While Joel may be a teenager, this isn’t exactly a Young Adult novel. Joel has had to grow up in many aspects due to his father’s passing and the economic status his family was left in.
* Even though I wanted Joel to become a rithmatist, I’m happy that he couldn’t, it would have resulted in another book about a prodigy in the world’s magic system. Additionally, it made the events more thrilling, since he’s more relatable to the reader.


## What I didn’t like
* Melody's personality, I simply can't buy that a person could be so chirpy, but that could just be me not knowing anyone IRL with that attitude.
* Custom cursing (again). It really breaks my immersion in the world.

## Conclusion
Brandon Sanderson does a wonderful job at teasing the many unknowns in this world, while at the same time providing a rich isolated environment where the events take place.

There's a whole lot more to learn about this world, and I'm eagerly waiting for more on The Rithmatist series.

ps. For the sequel, I'm fully expecting that Joel will bind one of the big chalk/charcoal creatures and become a rithmatist himself in the final act of the book.
