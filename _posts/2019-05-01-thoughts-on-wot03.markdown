I'll do this as a stream of thoughts I had throughout the book.

This one takes up the story a few months after the previous book. The girls and Matt are on their way to Tar Valon.

I must say straight away that I felt like the book wasted like half an hour of my time introducing each character again. This is the third book in the series, and they got introduced like we haven't heard of them before.

Another thing I didn't like right from the get go, was the step back on Perrin's  character development, he was supposed to have already accepted the wolf part of him, but apparently out of nowhere he's keeping them out. Later we get an 'explanation' in the form of a man who had lost himself by embracing his wolf side. That would've worked much better if it had been in the previous book, and had him help the party track the enemies more reluctantly.

It feels like I'm reading about the same people but it's not seamless feeling going from the previous book to this one.

After finishing it, I must say that I'm glad it ended, I feel like I had to force myself to the end. I think I'll be taking a break from The Wheel of Time series due to this book.
