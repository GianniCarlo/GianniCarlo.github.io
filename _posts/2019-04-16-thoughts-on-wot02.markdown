In this book, Rand and his companions, alongside a contingent of Shienaren soldiers, must get back the Horn of Valere after it gets stolen by dark friends and Padan Fain.

### What I liked
* This book also read like one of Brandon Sanderson. There's a clear build up of anticipation, for Rand to finally accept that he's the Dragon Reborn, all the while there's a lot of events unfolding along the way.
* Perrin also embraces his wolf side (finally).
* The ending was great, dead heroes riding again.

### What I sort of didn't like
* That the fight that Rand was having, was having a direct impact on the outcome of the other fight the heroes were fighting. I could buy that it could affect their morale, but in the book they explicitly stated that every time he advanced, the heroes advanced, and Everytime the dark one had the upper hand, they gave ground as well. It diminished the presence of the in the battlefield.

## Conclusion
This is a great sequel to The Eye of the World, and I hope the next books keep up this great work.
