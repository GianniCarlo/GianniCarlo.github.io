I'm a software developer based in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Out of all the platforms I've worked on, I like developing for iOS the most. I started a free open-source audiobookplayer called [BookPlayer](https://github.com/TortugaPower/BookPlayer) and you can see my side projects in my [pinned repositories](https://github.com/GianniCarlo) that I've used throughout the time.

I'm currently working at [Technisys](https://www.technisys.com) as an iOS developer. For my work history, you can check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-carlo-64362b66/).

**Other Interests**: I'm an avid reader of fantasy and sci-fi books, and I wholeheartedly recommend the books by [Brandon Sanderson](https://brandonsanderson.com), specially the series [The Stormlight Archive](https://brandonsanderson.com/books/the-stormlight-archive/). I'm also in the process of [learning Japanese](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/) and [learning how to draw](https://drawabox.com).
